        <h2>Qri is a Web of Datasets</h2>
        <p>Qri is built around datasets. Bigger than a spreadsheet, smaller than a database, datasets are all around us. qri is a big dataset bonanza, where people of all stripes can mix together all their sweet sweet data.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="open_source" class="feature_description">
        <h2>This Party is Free and Open Source</h2>
        <p>Data is better when we work together. Qri costs nothing to use, and is built as an open source project under a GPL license.</p>

      <div id="datasets_you_can_use" class="feature_description">
        <h2>Datasets You Can Actually Use</h2>
        <p>Every dataset change is tracked & attributed to an author, so you can audit whether the data you’re looking at meets your standards, and track changes as they happen.</p>

        <h3>Built on the Distributed Web</h3>
        <p>Qri is built from the ground up as a distribted network on top of IPFS. We chose IPFS because it’s both global and content-addressed — perfect for datasets.</p>
        <p>Data you’ve downloaded stays local. Content-addressing lets data be stored anywhere without sacrificing security. All this adds up to a web of datasets that is faster, more secure, and free.</p>

          <h3>Qri Uses Existing Specs</h3>
          <p>Wherever possible, we aim to use specifications & technologies that already exist. The end result is a natural set of integration points that makes qri less about being a “data platform” and more a series of integrations between platforms.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="git_style" class="feature_description">
          <h3>Git-style version control</h3>
          <p>Qri’s dataset versioning system is inspired by git, and signs each commit with your identifying keypair. Because qri is only about datasets, qri generates commit messages for you.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="data_formats" class="feature_description">
          <h3>Native support for JSON, CSV, CBOR data formats</h3>
          <p>Mix & match any format as you need, import from and export to any format.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="meta_specs" class="feature_description">
          <h3>Metadata based on library science</h3>
          <p>Librarians are better at metadata than developers, so we based our metadata spec on DCAT & Project Open Data, for cleaner integration with existing data catalogs</p>
        </div>
        <div id="json_schemas" class="feature_description">
          <h3>JSON-Schemas for validation & OpenAPIs</h3>
          <p>Dataset schemas are defined with the same spec that drives OpenAPIs. Datasets automatically generate a JSON API & accompanying OpenAPI documentation</p>
        </div>
        <div id="transformations" class="feature_description">
          <h3>Automate data munging with Python’s cousin: Skylark</h3>
          <p>Write configurable, repeatable transformations that can build on remote sources and other qri datasets, in a syntax that feels like Python.</p>
