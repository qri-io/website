Cool uses for qri: Publish, Sync, Collaborate, Inter-operate & Audit


**Publish**

_Qri draws attention to your work._

Put your data directly into the hands of those who want to see it and use it.

Example:
We built a dataset from Canadian Football League transactions to show injury rates over time by team.  We built in a visualization to make the data easy to interpret, and included the script used to generate the dataset, so anyone can see how it was converted from its original publication online into qri. This data is now easy to discover, use and update for professional and amateur researchers alike.

**Sync 1**

_Qri keeps your data fresh._

The data you rely on may change in an instant, or often. Use qri to automatically ingest web content into a structured, auto-updating, and versioned dataset, keeping your data fresh. 

Example:
Let’s say you use the price of oil as an input into another dataset you care about.  In qri, you can write a script that will pull in oil price data from anywhere on the web, create a structured, customized dataset that updates automatically at any frequency you set). The update is saved as a change  new version). This is particularly useful for data in the wild that updates often, like stock/commodity prices, sports scores, weather, opinion surveys, and more.

**Sync 2**

_Qri keeps your data fresh._

Design automated transformations to clean a dataset and prepare it for analysis. When the source data is updated, qri will clean it and incorporate it into your dataset. 

Example:
Many researchers rely on the American Community Survey (ACS) for their work. Every time a new survey is published, they download a copy and manually change column headers so the data can work with their existing scripts. With qri, they can write a transformation that performs all the alterations they need before they can begin working, use it to pull in the data, and instruct all future downloads of updated data to go through the same transformations. 

Not only do those researchers not have to do that tedious process again, but -because that dataset is public on qri- no one else has to either! If you have a different approach to renaming the columns, cool, we’ll support the way you do it, too.

**Collaborate**

_Data is better when we work together._

What are the chances someone has already done the same analysis you thought about doing yourself? Because datasets on qri are public, you can easily discover who has played with similar data before, and you can know exactly what they did to it. You can then take that data and ‘fork’ it, keep it, build on it, or propose changes to it(depending on how the dataset is licensed, of course!).

Example:
User A publishes a simple dataset showing US Presidents and their birthdays. User B discovers it, forks it, and adds a column to include each president’s place of birth. User C then takes that dataset and adds the date of each president’s death.

Now, a fourth users who was on a quest to learn which president lived the longest has been saved a massive amount of prep work. Cool.

-----------

**Inter-operate**

_Keep and use your existing tools._

Example:
Qri understands datasets, so unlike general version control systems, all datasets stored in qri can inter-operate because they have the same composition. Datasets are stored & transmitted in standard formats, allowing outside tools and systems to bypass qri entirely to interact directly with datasets qri produces & consumes

-----------

**Audit**

_Trust the data you depend on, and know how it changes._

Putting it all together, Qri helps you feel good about using a dataset, by showing you how, when and where it was originally published, how it’s been updated over time, and who has made what changes to it.

Example:
Every change to a dataset generates a new version - each of which is viewable on qri. If the dataset was created using a script, you can both view it and use it to recreate that dataset for yourself. This means you can trust the datasets on qri, and if you don’t trust others’ work, you can regenerate them yourself.
