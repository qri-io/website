**Qri is leading an open-source project to build software for dataset synching, versioning, storing and collaboration. We help solve super interesting data problems with individual data nerds (pro and not pro), non-profits, and commercial clients. Qri is led by a team in Brooklyn NY, and collaborators everywhere and anywhere.** 

**Here's more on the core Qri team.**
