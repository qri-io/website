### Technical Definition:
```
Structure designates a deterministic definition for working with a dataset.
Structure is a concrete handle that provides precise details about how to interpret a given
piece of data (the reference to the data itself is provided elsewhere, specifically in the dataset struct )
These techniques provide mechanisms for joining & traversing multiple structures.
This example is shown in a human-readable form, for storage on the network the actual
output would be in a condensed, non-indented form, with keys sorted by lexographic order.
