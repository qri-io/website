Starlark is a scripting language from Google that is mostly a subset of python. This package implements starlark as a _transformation syntax_. Starlark transformations are about as close as one can get to the full power of a programming language for generating datasets.

### Key Differences from Python

- No While Loops
- No Recursion
- Variables are frozen after mutation
- Strings are not iterable

There are more, see https://docs.bazel.build/versions/0.23.0/skylark/language.html and https://github.com/google/skylark/blob/master/doc/spec.md

## Starlark In Qri

Qri transformations have a few rules on top of starlark itself:

* Qri defines special functions that act as entry points to the script. Qri will call them, your script does not need to
* These functions always receive a context
* The return value of these functions is available as part of the context passed to future functions
* Special functions are always called in the same order


## Special Functions

There are two functions that qri will call if defined:

* `download(ctx)`
* `transform(ds,ctx)`

#### download(ctx):
Download is the only function in which you can make an http request or get an http response, or download a xlsx file, aka the only place in a transform where you can get data from a website or server. The download function is always run before the transform function.

The transform function will receive the dataset returned from the download function as part of its context, set at `ctx.download`.

#### transform(ds, ctx):
The transform function receives the dataset as its previous version, if one exists. If no prior version exists, `ds` will be an _empty dataset_, which is, a dataset with no fields set.

The transform function can pull from the previous dataset and transform context, and call any function defined within the script. Internet access is disabled while `transform` is executing.

## Configuration

You can inject variables into the transform through the transform config section in the dataset file. For example:

<!--
docrun:
  filltype: dataset.Dataset
-->
```yaml
# dataset.yaml file
transform:
  scriptpath: transform.star
  config:
    name: Joe
    number: 5556578909
```

In your transform script, you can get the name and number by using the context:

<!--
docrun:
  test:
    call: transform(ds, ctx)
# TODO(dlong): Save the above dataset.yaml and pass it to this transform
-->
```python
load("qri.star", "qri")

def transform(ds, ctx):
  name = ctx.get_config("name")
  number = ctx.get_config("number")
  ds.set_body({"name": name, "number": number})
```

## Secrets

Sometimes you need special keys or information in your transform, but you donâ€™t want anyone else to see. This is where transform secrets come in. You can add a private api key, for example, and not be worried that another user will have access to your secret key if they look at your dataset.

<InfoBlock type='warning'>
  Providing secrets to a script is always a risk. Qri will warn you whenever you provide a secret to a transform.
</InfoBlock>

You add secrets using the `--secrets` flag on `qri save`.

```
qri save --file transform.star --secrets api_key,SOME-PRIVATE-KEY-HERE
```

To get that secret, use the context:

<!--
docrun:
  test:
    call: download(ctx)
-->
```python
def download(ctx):
  api_key = ctx.get_secret("api_key")
  # do something here to fetch from a server
  return {"webserver": "result"}
```
